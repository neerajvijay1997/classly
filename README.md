# CLASSLY

This server provides a class booking system designed for studios. It allows studio owners to create classes, and studio members to book those classes.

### Key Features:
- **Studio Owners**:
  - Can create and manage classes for their studios.
  - Each class has a name, start and end times, and a limited capacity.
- **Studio Members**:
  - Can browse available classes.
  - Can book classes, track their bookings, and attend sessions.

### Usage Scenarios:
- **As a Studio Owner**: I want to create classes for my studio so that my members can attend them.
- **As a Studio Member**: I want to book classes at studio so I can attend them.

This system is ideal for fitness studios, workshops, and any other activity-based studios where scheduling and booking management is required.
